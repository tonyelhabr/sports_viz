It's important to remember, Pep's players do what he says, and he will, without a doubt, not play them if they hurt the team or don't follow his tactics. With Mahrez, Pep signed him because he knows how he played at Leicester; he's an explosive, flairy, player, with mad tekk. That's who he signed. He's a Man U Ronaldo (Ignore the Man U), who thrives off of wing play, and taunting defenders. And when he's on hot form, he's a TOP TOP player. Look at the Premier League winning 2015/2016 season, which he won the PFA award. His consistency is an issue, I understand, but that's because he's not always starting like Sterling, Aguero, and others who rarely don't start. Once he gets used to starting, ( let's say 6 games to get used to starting), he'll be whippin' it. I guess it would help if he crossed a bit more, but the point I'm trying to make is that he's doing exactly what Pep tells him. I'm sure at every training, every powerpoint before the games, Pep's telling him to do what he's doing. 

thanks for reading btw, this is my first post, and i really do love mahrez, he's an inspiration to me as a muslim footballer, but at least i'm educated unlike the facebook dads complaining in the comments.",0.47,0,0,0

He’s already world class at the the most important part of the game. We need goals and this dude can score them for us for the next 10 years+ if we make him the priority.

I think Messi has declined at least good 20% in the last year and half but he's still a great damn player. You can not refuse to sign Messi, obviously. 

But here's a thing. Your midfield felt clumsy and lacking fluidness all up until you've started playing Bernardo and Gundo as a midfield pair in front of Rodri.

Before that Rodri had games where he was legit 2/10 and now he's legit playing at very least 8/10 every game in my personal opinion. He was always a world class, he just needed players around him that suit him.

This is the issue with KDB. He's easily the best midfielder in the world but your midfield will never be as fluid as it needs to be when you play both KDB and Rodri at midfield 3. I predicted this before Rodri had his first match with City and I stand behind my words.

Both Rodri and KDB are intelligent players that know when and how to run, but you can only have one such midfielder to make it work while other 2 need to be constantly running and pressing. This is why your midfield lacked a lot of things until KDB started playing as a false 9 and eventually when he got injured, Bernardo and Gundo became starting midfield pair. 

This wouldn't have been issue had you bought a DM that is more similiar to Ferna, but it is what it is. I think Pep should find a way to play all 4 of them, maybe a diamond or 352 with KDB as a second striker. It could be legit murder. But I promise you once KDB is back in midfield, you'l see again what I'm talking about.

With that said, if you really end up playing Rodri/KDB and Bernardo or Gundo midfield, and then add Messi who really has no work rate on the wing, I suspect very bad things will happen.

Messi and KDB are in top 5 players of the world for sure, but that doesn't mean anything. You need players to suit eachother and you need stability, fine pressing and workrate. 

We'll see how it goes. But as of right now, your team looks to be on elite level with KDB out of midfield. And he's the best mfkin midfielder I know at the moment. Sometimes that's just not enough.",0.45,0,0,0

2 requests before we begin.

One, do not downvote without reading the whole thing just because you hate Pogba- the whole point of this is why you shouldn’t be.

Two, if you feel my reasoning makes sense, an upvote and a word of support would do wonders. Pretty sure I’m already amongst the minority with my solidarity for Paul, so some backing wouldn’t hurt.

Enough with the disclaimers, let’s get down to business.

*(Note: Each section has a TLDR, but reading through is appreciable)*

# Career Stats:

To everyone considering Pogba a flop, let's first take a glance at his stats across clubs. It isn't very detailed, but it's enough to understand my point.

&#x200B;

|Team|Appearances|Goals|Assists|Minutes Played|Minutes Played Per Goal Contribution|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|United U23(2010-12)|21|3|7|1,523|152.3|
|Juventus (2012-16 )|178|34|39|14068|192.71|
|France(2013- )|75|10|7|5832|343.05|
|**Manchester United (2016-)**|**177**|**34**|**35**|**13077**|**189.52**|

Surprising ? Most people are. **Paul Pogba has higher goal contributions per minutes played at United than he did at Juventus and France**. Several times I've heard that he's ""lackluster"" at United because he's in a more disciplined, restrictive role compared to his time in Juve and for the national team. While he doesn't play a very agressive role in our midfield, it's obvious that he's still outperforming his previous stints from his current position. His stats are average for an attacking mid, but here he doesn't play in that position. Both Soljskaer and Mourinho have played him on a deeper role towards the left, where he usually wins the ball and makes passes toward the centre or sprints forward in a counter, his most common way of scoring.

TLDR- Pogba is better than you thought he was at United.

# Drawbacks

One true concern about Paul is his susceptibility to injury. Since arriving at Manchester, Pogba has fallen prey to 9 major injuries, missing a total of 56 matches across 5 years. It's not exactly Dembele- level bad, but for his wages, he'll be expected by the fans to be more resilient, and rightly so.

The other common issue that the fans find with him is his apparent lack of interest in United and the desire to play for other teams, especially Zidane's Madrid. In my eyes, this isn't a problem for us at all, unless the player completely stops putting an effort for the team(aka Bale for Madrid). Ronaldo made it extremely clear, right from his second season, that it was his dream to play for Madrid, and he wouldn't have stayed here for 5 seasons if not for Fergie. Yet, he's loved by our fans even today because of how he performed for us. I'll agree that Pogba's performance, in no way is comparable to Ronnie's. (but really, can anyone be like Ronnie ?) He has to give more for the club to earn that respect, but he hasn't done anything to deserve their hate either! He has a great relationship with all our players, new and old, both on and off the field, and has always made it clear since Mou's departure, how much he loves playing for United.

TLDR: Paul Pogba has never expressed ***disinterest*** in playing for Ole's United. In fact, it's quite the contrary.

So, why the controversy ? Who is responsible for this shitstorm at the end of the day ?

# Mino Raiola.

## One. Nasty. Cunt.

For the uninitiated, Mino is the agent for Paul, and many other top players such as Zlatan, Haaland, De Ligt and Mkhitaryan. He's one of the top paid agents in world football, and definitely the most controversial. He has clashed with many top clubs, including Ajax, Barca, Madrid, Juventus, Liverpool and United. Before UEFA had implemented the agent's commission ceiling on player fees, Mino had made exorbitant amounts of money with his huge rates, and is also considered by some as the trigger of turning Ajax into a feeder club. Throughout the years, he's made several controversial and absurd claims against the clubs and managers his top-earning players play for. A few of them are here below:

&#x200B;

* After Ibrahimovic struggled to perform at Barca

>*“Johan Cruyff can go to hell! He is a nobody, he is becoming old and didn’t have the courage to continue his management career as he doesn’t know how to train a modern club. ""*  
>  
>*“Why didn’t Cruyff tell Zlatan that he wasn’t suited to Spanish football before Barcelona signed him? I think Cruyff should be in a mental asylum with Guardiola, so they can sit there quietly and play cards together.""*

&#x200B;

* After Balotelli struggled to perform at Liverpool

>*""I won’t judge him as a coach*(Klopp)*, even if for me he isn’t a great tactician, but I don’t think he realised we were talking about a person. Mario was exemplary, he never complained even when training alone.""*  
>  
>*“It’s not enough to say Klopp was unfair: he was a piece of shit.”*

&#x200B;

* Excerpt from a leaked phone call with former Juve director, Juliano Moggi, after a rejected contract extension for Ibrahimovic

>*“Tomorrow, I’ll keep the player at home all day; he won’t show up for training,” Raiola replied. “I then have an appointment with the directors of Ajax at noon, but I’ll come at two …”*

These are atrocious in their own right, but with United, it's been way worse. Here's what **Ferguson** had to say about Raiola over the years:

>*""Paul Pogba? He just had a bad agent, a shit bag.""*  
>  
>*“There are one or two football agents I simply do not like and Mino Raiola, Paul Pogba’s agent, is one of them.*  
>  
>*“I distrusted him from the moment I met him. He became Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s agent while he was playing for Ajax, and eventually he would end up representing Pogba, who was only 18 years old at the time.*  
>  
>*“We had Paul under a three-year contract, and it had a one-year renewal option which we were eager to sign. But Raiola suddenly appeared on the scene and our first meeting was a fiasco.""*

Several of his  own clients (players) have turned against him, stating his constant monitoring and pestering to approach more excelling clubs as a nuisance. Jesse Lingard is the latest of many to cut relations with him.

Many fans also find blame with Pogba regarding his transfer fee, a former world record of £89m, but what many are not aware of, is that **Mino Raiola earned £40 Million for Pogba's transfer, a whooping 45%.  This is after he schemingly negotiated a free transfer  for Paul to Juve, a move that wasn't sanctioned with Ferguson beforehand.**

## Conclusion aka TLDR for the whole article:

Paul Pogba hasn't underperformed at United, and an argument can be made for the contrary. His wishes to play for another club has never impacted his desire to win at Manchester. Most of the negativity surrounding him is created by his agent Mino Raiola, an incredibly toxic cunt who prefers to jump ship to a more lucrative club at every turn. Our boy Jesse did himself good by getting out of his grip. As fans, we have to back the player and shun this fraud. Or even better, ignore him. He makes a living out of stirring up these shitstorms.

I apologise if I came across as too blunt, and for any formatting or spelling errors, but I have barely seen a single comment or post supporting Pogba lately. I wish I could've put even more effort into this, but that's all I can do for now. Pogba is our lad, and we shouldn't be shouting at him. Also, this issue doesn't deserve the limelight right now.

reddevils,itmhdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/itmhdu/very_unpopular_opinion_on_us_potentially_missing/,Very unpopular opinion on us potentially missing out on Reguilion to Spurs,False,132,336,2020-09-16 01:56:28,"So I’ve been seeing the majority of Manchester United fans here feeling relieved/or being happy that we aren’t taking Reguilion on any buyback clause, which would essentially be a glorified loan in which we “develop” a Real Madrid player only to have them get him back in 1-2 years for only a 5-10 mil profit. I understand why most people would not be too pleased with this kind of offer because it’s not as ideal as just getting him on a normal transfer.

But what I don’t understand is all the talk about prestige and how such a deal is beneath us. First let’s talk about his quality. Reguilion is currently a starter for Spain and there is little doubt he is going to improve almost every team in the world. He might even be the difference we need between a CL/EL finish, seeing how injury prone Shaw is. Even Real Madrid wants him back which speaks to his potential to develop even further. Even if they want him back to sell him at a higher price, there is also an assumption that Reguilion would have did very well during his time here to justify such a price tag. 

In the past few seasons we’ve seen Arsenal take on Ceballos in a loan and Chelsea take on Kovacic as well, and both have done reasonably well in their first team. Not everyone would have expected them to stay as they did, but it’s often understated how much a club’s playing style and vision can grow into a player. If Reguilion does very well here and even wins something, he might prefer being a starter here than a backup to Mendy at Real Madrid. If he doesn’t do too well, we’d be happy to have Real Madrid take him back for essentially no net cost to us at all. We already have enough trouble offloading deadwoods so we don’t need any more.

One of the main reasons why players are joining Chelsea (like Werner and Ziyech) and players are staying in Arsenal (like Aubameyang) is precisely because of their current performances and strength. Good performances in league and cup games give confidence to players because most top players wants to join a winning project, and not a losing one, regardless of their prestige. 

The reality is this: we have to get top 4 and find some cup successes if we want our players to continue staying here or to attract even better players. Do we want Pogba to sign a new contract? Do we want to try getting Sancho next season? I’m sorry to say, but no amount of “prestige” is going to make our important players renew their contracts or enable us to sign Sancho when we have to settle for a Europa League slot next season.

With the current squad we have, we are only 3-4 injuries away from becoming mid table quality, and I’m being generous when I say this. With only 3 subs per match and so many consecutive matches, most of our players are going to burn out as well. If you’ve watched our matches last season, you would know just how frustrating it is to watch us play without Bruno or when the whole squad got absolutely lethargic towards the end of the season. This season is going to be more of the same, and might be even worse, bearing in mind we were still training hard individually during the Covid break, as compared to right now still having disjointed training sessions with some players separated and most having just returned from holidays as well.

Honestly I’m getting tired from all the talk about history and how we are traditionally a big club that players should want to come to, and yet have absolutely nothing to show for. We haven’t been close to EPL or UCL champions for almost a decade now and I’d hate for us to become another Liverpool that fetishes on how much of a “big” club we are due to past successes. Majority of our recent transfers are either signed young or came here for the money. If we didn’t pay huge wages to attract players, would we even have half our current squad? This goes to show that in today’s footballing world, football is not so much about “prestige” or “big clubs” or “selling clubs”, and more about whether players buy into the club’s and manager’s vision. We can make snide remarks about how players who come here for the money are mercenaries, but what else can we offer them at this point? Prestige? All of us here at this sub would love to play for Manchester United because we are fans, but imagine if you weren’t, would you settle for some prestige and a EL semi final run, when you are a CL quality player?

Ole needs to be backed with the players he wants, regardless of purchase type, and if he needs Reguilion to compete for both CL and the league, then get him Reguilion FFS. Lesser clubs like Liverpool have managed to strengthen themselves into title contenders and they didn’t need too much money or prestige; they simply needed a manager who got most of the players he wanted and who wanted to play for him. 

We need to recruit more than just young and promising players because we need players that will elevate our team for the full season, guaranteeing us a top 4 finish and maybe some cup successes. And I don’t really care if they are loans or buybacks. I just want us to do well enough to be attractive enough for even better players to want to come here. I buy into Ole’s vision, and I want the players who come here to do the same as well.

Sorry if this triggers anyone but I just felt I had to get this off my chest, peace out. Also sorry if I broke any rules by posting this because it’s my first time posting here.

Edit: Despite the downvotes, I’ll stand by what I say. With our current squad depth and the amount of fixtures we have, I’m not confident of even a top 4 placing. Having Reguilion with us instead of BW covering might just well prove to be the difference in winning some games that might get us into top 4/win a cup. 

I understand the concerns about a buy-back clause. It’s fair to say we will will have the shorter end of the stick, and hence not look at such a deal favourably. But to say things like “we are not a stepping club” or things like “a buyback clause is beneath a prestigious club like us” is absolutely oblivious to the fact of our current state. Gone are the days when players looked to Manchester United as the most prestigious British club to play for. We need players that fit into Ole’s vision like how Liverpool got players that fit into Klopp’s vision, or we will end up exactly the same way as our bitter rivals reminiscing about our past. Ole has to get the players he needs in order for us to perform, and I couldn’t be less bothered about whatever loans or buybacks as long as they fit into his vision.",0.57,132,0,0

I can understand this frustation, but first of all, let me say that literally we're linked to EVERY player in EVERY transfer Windows, and its well known that United is a bargaining tool for a lot of players/ agents / clubs to get their own deal done. 

Transfer Windows are also conditioned by a lot of things, mainly the objectives for the upcoming season, right? And as fans in this subreddit, i guess that no one literally have an idea about those objectives, right ? No one is close to the club , to the board, to Ole , to the players ... to be able to gives us a true objectives.

So here' my take on this issue, and why do I believe that United is going much stronger into this season, compared to the general Media and Fan feel. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


So first of all, let me talk about **Business Transfer**, the past years, and how United lost their way. 

For years, we have been masters in the transfer windows, being linked to top player, and closing deal quickly. Two reasons for this, SAF and a competent Board. All of our business were silent, even if we were linked to everything and everyone, there's few transfers that have been a media shitshow.

Since the departure of SAF, and the incompetent Ed got involved, United Brand in the Transfer Business totally changed: We overpay player, we doesnt entertain good relationship with clubs / agents, and we totally lost our way of doing business. And it still hurts us now. 

&nbsp;


The best Thing that could have happened to the club, is to have Ole back, who clearly put a vision for the club, with clear objectives on the type of target and how much is the limit for a player. And Ed seems to be following. For the past 18 months, Maguire and Bruno were the two deals that took a long time : Everyone knew we were in for a CB, and whoever was going to sell us a CB was going to bleed us to death. For Bruno, Sporting Board are literal thieves , so no need to dig up more than this. But at the end, we got our deals done, and its there to see for everyone that those transfer were vital for us in our progression.  Now lets talk about Sancho. 

Remember how the deal with Mikhy went very badly between the two clubs because of Raiola ? Well Dortmund still holds a grudge about that. And it was mainly Ed incompetence. Never broke good relationship with a club. BVB are in no Hurry to sell this summer, and we’re no hurry to buy him this summer (i ‘ll explain why later). He still got 2 or 3 years in his contract, he’s still young playing in a good team, and he seems to want to come to play at United at some point. Next year, Dortmund we’ll need to think seriously about selling him if he doesn’t extend his contract, if they want to cash in some money. 
And the Deal didn’t get Done at the end , because BVB didn’t want to negotiate with us directly, mainly because of Mikhy transfer …  Transfer Deals are way harder than we think .. 

&nbsp;


Now lets talk about Reguillon and Thiago. Two players available that can « improve the squad ». But really ? at what cost ? 

We were never going to accept Reguillon Clause, and Thiago is on a very High wages ( so if we want to shift our brand again to pay what’s necessary and not overpay, we have to draw some limits, right ? ) But moreover, we do have players in our squad right ? We as a fans we love shitting on our squad , but let’s see who can actually play in LB and CM spot for us :  For the LB SPOT we have : Shaw , Brandon Williams , TFM 
and those are the players who can play into the midfield : Matic, Mctominay , Fred, Pogba , Bruno , VDB … 

It would have been great «  additions » to the squad, but if you buy one of them or both , we surely need to sell ( We stil have Rojo , Smalling , Dalot , Lingard, Pereira , and a shit tons of good players coming from the academy : Levitt, Hannibal , Garner , Mengi, Laird … ) So the cost is clearly blocking young development , and you still need to sell players in a difficult COVID market 

&nbsp;


&nbsp;



So this is the part of the transfer and why its difficult to make decisions about those deals, and we have to analyze that with the objectives United should realistically be setting after last Season.  So this is season we’re BACK in CL , i remember when we were young, and there were not much english football at night ( league Cup, and sometimes PL games) CL was fucking great to watch on tuesday and wednesday. Well we’re back in it after a year in EL. But realistically , we literally played 3 ( or 4 ) seasons in the CL since SAF left.. And we did not compete for the PL , and all of our seasons ends with : Will Manchester United make top 4 ? … 

I think the most realistic objectives we can have this year is to easily qualify for CL. It shouldn’t be a case of whether we make Top 4 or not , it should be a case of we’re in the Top 4 easily … so we can fight on very front. Getting into CL easily would mean one great thing in sport and business in general : STABILITY. 
The team improved over the past 18 months in every aspect, and no one can deny that.  But with improvement, Stability should come too , adding new walls  to a hanging building would make it fall right ? Pretty much the same with a sports team. 

&nbsp;



We’re going into this season with a HUGE squad ( i can link to a precedent post,  but players were missing ) : 

&nbsp;



**GK :**   De Gea  - Henderson  -  Grant  - Romero(is still at the club, Villa move off, so lets see where he end up) 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




Defenders | Midfielders  | Forward 
---------|----------|---------- 
AWB | Matic | Rashford 
Dalot | Mctominay | Martial 
TFM | Fred | Greenwood 
Maguire | VDB | Ighalo 
Jones | Bruno |
  Lindelof | Pogba | 
Smalling | Mata |
  Tuanzebe | Lingard | 
Bailly | Pereira |  
Rojo | James | 
Shaw | | 
 Williams  | | 
Mengi    | | 
Laird    | | 

&nbsp;


This squad has enough depth and quality in it to play this season. Do you remember  last Year ? We didn’t have Bruno for half a season , Pogba for practically a whole season , Rashford who missed out on a lot of important Games, Mctominay who got injured in a bad time. And you know what ? this squad is still young, averaging what ?25 y o ? So still lots of room to improve. And we finished 3rd ( by losing or drawing some shitty games) , and we played 3 semi finals.  

So i can totally understand the frustration for the lack of transfer activities, but only if our objectives was to compete and WIN the PL this year (which is in my opinion delusional to think that this is our objectives for this season).   

So this is my opinion, and it will be unpopular , but we have a very good squad for this season. If we don’t get Sancho this year , no problem, it will give either a chance for some to break into the team or we may sign a temporary solution or a young talent. Because if we stabilize this year, and we do get into CL next year easily , we will bring some standings back to OT, would make it easier for player to get attracted (even if we did a pretty good job to attract player even if we were dog shit on the pitch).

Take Ndidi as an example, the sole defensive midfielder for Leceister. Ndidi does the job of this two players together and much more effectively (see last 2 leceister games against us when Ndidi plays). McFred are not great at tackling nor have good defensive awareness as Mctominay simply gives away too many fouls. Fred on the other hand runs and runs and runs but barely wins the ball or do anything with it when he wins it. Midfield pressing is pointless when most of the time opposition players can just hold it off them or when you have to press again after losing it in a dumb fashion. But I think we get carried away by them running around the pitch, except the problem is they have like 20% productivity. They only seem to play well when they shore up the defence or sit back and only choosing there time patiently to hassle the opposition like against PSG first leg or Liverpool in the league. Ultimately, my problem with the pressing isn't all down to McFred, as Manchester United is the only team I have seen pressing for very long without winning the ball, it is baffling. 

McFred lack of creativity is not exactly a secret so I will not dwell on that but my plea is that people remain patient with Mctominay as he is still young and turning out to be an excellent all-rounder player.

Moving on, there lack of creativity affects the team when playing against opposition who sits back as we rely only on Bruno (also obvious). As for Rashford, I really do not rate that much in terms of creating chances, and needs like a million chances to score a goal. People think this is a recent problem but the fact is he has always being average at finishing especially during Mourinho's time. However Martial is normally our best finisher by a mile, his finishing this season is just strange. With a poor midfield, and the fact that Rashford or sometimes Greenwood (still developing) plays in like one specific manner (gets the ball, tries to run at opposition and either loses it or have a bad end product by being selfish) means our only element of surprise is when Bruno pulls off some magic or when the whole team outwork opposition players which can not be a consistent way of playing.

I have also seen many people on this sub are pro-Ole (which is understandable) but one of the reason why some fans generally do not like Ole is tactics and creativity. You can quote to me and say we have scored a huge numbers of goals ever since Ole has come in but I believe these stats are misleading as we only seem to score certain types of goals and EPL is in a wierd phase currently. Also, we cannot break down small teams which is most important in the EPL. The fact is we play the same way like we do since Ole came in and the only improvement is effort and Bruno. Sooner or later, Ole will be exposed because his team selections, tactics or players performance are very predictable.

My overall suggestion to improvement is let Van de beek play more games to be match fit, buy and play more natural winger instead of using players who were once pure strikers as main wingers (Rashford, Greenwood and Martial but DJ is a pace merchant), and give more attacking freedom and risk to Mctominay. With this our attacking attacking will be more fluid, and less reliant on one part if the pitch.",0.54,7,0,0

Reddit admins offered us a chance to try out Reddit Power Ups (more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/iicyi1/testing_a_new_concept_with_select_subreddit/))

What it means? - It allows the sub to use features like replying with gifs, higher quality videos and custom smileys.

The way it works is that at least 25 users need to contribute as power users (either by being premium users or just buying it) every month for whole of  the community to use these features

Having said that, we do **NOT** intend on giving any special privileges to these ""power users"" besides  their names getting displayed on the sidebar of this sub - That happens automatically. We don't have any control over it. Some of these contributors can be existing mods but even as moderators we are not signing up for contributing to this feature regularly.

Do NOT ask us to be made a moderator in exchange for becoming power user.

The Sub will not be manipulated by the power users and if we fall short of 25 contributors, we just accept it and move on.

The feature is already enabled and some of us are already using it. If the sub wants to give it a try, you are welcome. We will let the sub decide on this one.

Obviously this is a way for reddit to monetize but its a feature few other communities already have. If it's not popular or not used, we should be able to opt out of it and disable it later

LiverpoolFC,leyg0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/leyg0f/the_thiago_problem/,The Thiago Problem,False,0,72,2021-02-07 23:22:16,"Let me preface this by saying I believe Thiago is a world class player. What he did at times at Barca and to a greater extent in the CL at Bayern was breathtaking. However, this is not the midfielder we can work with right now. He is one of the causes of our downturn in form and it's just the way he plays.

Naturally, he's creative. His passing range is brilliant. However he isn't dynamic and his placement on the field leaves a lot to be desired. If you look at a midfield that has Gini, Hendo and Fabinho - you'll notice VERY clearly how Gini plays off the left, Hendo off the right and Fabinho covering the front 2. What this offers us in the way of cover is that when one of our wingbacks loses the ball - Hendo or Gini will become emergency LB/RB's - they're both good at dispossessing the ball and/or holding up the player until Trent/Robbo get back. Recently you'll have seen Trent be exposed because he is having to run back much quicker because Thiago isn't covering that role. He's also not great at dispossession - he's pretty bad at tackling evident in most games you'll see. He also picks up the occasional yellow and the way he does it means he can't be as combative for the rest of the game as you'd get from others. Fabinho/Hendo/Gini often don't get booked early or at all. Means they can put a foot in more often until they do.

So, that said - our defence is more exposed when we go forward. Everyone in the team is having to work harder. With 2 senior, legitimate CB's we'd somewhat have more in the way of cover but given we're already weakened defensively this just adds to that problem. Trent has come in for some real criticism lately and while not unwarranted for some of his crosses and losing the ball - remember the lad doesn't have Hendo in front of him to bail him out. Confidence then, is low on the right hand side of the field. This has meant too, that we've not been able to get forward as quickly because Trent is either fresh from covering his own arse or not joining every single time Salah gets the ball as an option. You'll have noticed Trent is much closer to the halfway line when the midfield is in possession rather than bombing down the right hand side.

There's also the pace he plays at. Thiago is a fantastic passer of the ball, but when he's given the ball quickly, when was the last time you saw him pass a first time to the wing or over the top? He takes the pace and element of surprise out of our counter attacks - at Barca he had Messi who would dribble through or Lewandowski who would bang one in from anywhere at Bayern but our players don't play like they do. So when he's given the ball while he will occasionally pick out a peach - this isn't enough. It takes Firmino out of the game when Thiago is continually passing the ball to either wing on the ground as he's expecting Firmino to be the ""off the shoulder"" striker that he has never been. Firmino faces the goal and isn't seeing enough of the ball in the positions Thiago occupies. You'll see Hendo wait until Firmino drops back before he gives the ball to him. That's not been happening with Thiago.

Stylistically, Thiago doesn't suit us right now. He's a phenomenal player, he really is - but he would fit in a diamond at the top or in the centre of a 4. The way this team plays, and the troubles we've been having with our defence - he's getting a free pass and is seen as the saviour when realistically he's a large part of the way we're playing. That's not to say he won't become the player we need but I groan when I see him on the teamsheet because I know we won't have the heavy metal intensity.

Todays game wasn't on his shoulders, Alisson made some rare mistakes and we just couldn't get going with some bad performances in the second half but we should step back and look at why the team isn't the same we saw last year in my opinion.

I am personally truly disappointed at what this particular forum and the entire fanbase has become in the past few years. People sending death threats to Kepa, abusing Tammy on twitter,  making Alonso, Jorginho and Morata back in the day turning of comments on IG and constantly,  constantly explaining how Willian has always been a bad winger, Tammy will never be good enough,  CHO is mega over-rated and many more examples of almost hate towards our own players.

I can give tons of examples but the latest one which has had me feeling embarrassed to be a Chelsea fan is the fact that so many people on this sub already set in stone how Tammy is finished and he will never be our number 1 striker, how Giroud should be the number 2 next year and Tammy should stay on the bench at best. People claiming he is bad because of this or that, how can't  do this and that and therefore he is finished. 

I don't want to turn this into a discussion about if Tammy is good or not, I just want to express my utter disappointment how the person who has had probably the biggest contribution to us being in contention for top 4 with his 19 g/a in about 2/3 of the available playing time is being disrespect by his own fanbase.  People go and wank over the signing of Havertz, Timo, Ziyech but non of the would have been possible if we sitting in 10th, because that is where we would have been without a Tammy. Even after the abuse he got following the penalty last summer,  he did not give up and he gave his best all season. You can see what scoring means to him, how he is devastated after every shot he misses, he is first and foremost one of our own and  he cares for the club, but I guess some fans think hating on him and his teammates is how they want to show their support.....

I am not saying giroud didn't deserve to start, He was phenomenal against sevilla but adding him to the team led to attacks being based more on crossing then the one touch football that was before. Suddenly that we had a target man there were less attempts to play out from the back and more ball forwards, pressing became less intense and the primary tactics switched to getting full backs up the field and crossing to the target man. Werner on the wing certainly shouldn't have happened but Giroud's form gave lampard another reason to play werner up top. Also looking at the trend of Chelsea goals even in recent games the goals have come from a low cross or a set piece. West ham game was an anomaly because i feel they lost their discipline. Full backs especially Chillwell on left side doesn't seem to attempt low crosses and the accuracy is quite poor as compared to early season. Also somehow people believe that Giroud's ability in air is exceptional but truth is neither Giroud or Tammy have done well with aerial balls against a physical opposition. I think Lampard gave in to fan demand to start giroud which indirectly led to others like Werner losing their edge. Giroud should have been kept for cup competitions wherein weekly form doesn't matter much. That is in my opinion, i would like to hear any other views on this.",0.52,4,0,0

Now I understand one reason for that is the supposed £80m tag and I understand that but no one (including & especially Marina) is planning to pay that amount.

I’m gonna lay out my reasons for wanting to sign Chilwell 

1. PL proven: We are signing a lot of foreign players and people are underestimating the impact of 5 new starting players who are unfamiliar with our team and more importantly the league. Having a player fully familiar with the pace and intensity of the PL will be extremely valuable especially in defense. 


2. Age: He’s 23 and will only get better. That alone explains why he is more expensive than the other touted left backs. If he performs averagely even, he’ll still have a good resale value 3,4,5 years down the road. 

3. Alternative Targets: Both Telles & Rosens are far better in an attacking sense. Rosens in fact only plays as a LWB. Similarly, Tagli is much older and while he’s quality, I genuinely don’t think anyone can say for certain that he’ll be able to handle the pace and physicality of the league. Also these players are at their peak whereas Ben’s prime years are ahead of him. I know Leicester fell apart in the last 10-12 GWs but they were superb defensively for most of the season and Chilwell was part of that good defense. 

4. Price Tag: No one is paying Leicester £80m for him. They missed the CL, Ben is going to push for the move and we can easily bring the price tag down to £40-£50m which I think is worth it. 




A Telles or Tagli while a lower upfront investment will have zero resale value whereas Ben will still be worth £30-£50m after 4,5 years at the club depending on performances. 
So a £30m investment into a 27 year old with no resale value or PL experience < a £50m investment in a PL proven talent who will still be worth a lot of money 4,5 years down the road. This is my opinion. Especially when you take into consideration that Ben’s best years are ahead of him and our other targets have already peaked. 

And I understand people will attack the ‘PL proven’ side but we are signing at least 3 foreign players, probably another CB & GK! I think signing a PL proven defender is very valuable in that context. Combined with his age and resale value, a £20m premium is worth it.


EDIT: I feel a lot of people are attracted to Telles, Tagli & Rosen SOLELY based on their price tags. And the rest is wishful thinking that they won’t be an Aurier or a Kolasinac! No one has seen them regularly enough and even what we’ve heard of these players is praise of their attacking output so the whole point of this post it to take away the money side of things (let Marina negotiate that) and to simply objectively try to give reasons why Ben Chilwell is my favorite option amongst these on pure footballing reasons- ability, potential, PL experience, age.",0.54,14,0,0

(It’s not all bad),False,1,17,2020-08-29 13:09:02,"I know a lot of fans are angry with the cash flow situation. Partly Covid, partly Owners are to blame for this.

I do not think we’re alone in this financial situation and I believe we’re making the right moves so far. 

Out: 

**Roberto**. Had to go. Bag of errors. We probably paid a little something out so he got his move but he’s now off the wage bill and has already been replaced with Randolph. 

**Zabaleta**: I didn’t really rate him anyway. Our fans gushed over him but he ended up probably our 3rd choice right back even though he was one of the top earners in the club at £90k a week. What kind of nonsense is that? I don’t buy this cliche dressing room aura stuff he was supposed to have brought with him. We did better when he wasn’t with the club, than when he was with the club. Won’t be missed. We blew millions on him last season for little return. 

**Ngakia**: Ok, he did a decent job under difficult circumstances but a lot of his game showed inexperience. Disappointing to lose a youngster but I don’t think he was ready to be a Premier League starter. Obviously I’d have preferred he was kept on and hoped he’d develop more but his loss doesn’t damage the first team in my opinion.

**Sanchez** Brought in as cover. Was on £40-50k a week. Long term injury. Barely played. When he did it looked like we needed better cover when he’d make a massive game changing mistake. No loss to the squad. Money saved. 

**Ajeti** Backup striker who cost a fair bit. Our fans got really excited about him pushing Hernandez for the immediate 2nd choice backup role. Hernandez left and he still managed to end up 3rd choice when Antonio moved up front. No loss to the squad really, didn’t have a shot on target. Shame he lost his value so quickly. 

**Hugill** Almost identical to Ajeti. Backup striker who didn’t play and lost his value. 

I think some fans have overlooked our recent additions from January.

Ins

**Randolph** £4m on a backup goalkeeper was out of desperation and probably too much money. Especially as he was turning 33. But I think he’s a solid backup goalkeeper for us. 

**Soucek** One of the major influences in our turnaround and helped us stay up. Signing him permanently for £19m doesn’t seem like such a bad deal, even after Covid started. Important signing.

**Cullen** Not a signing as such but he returns to us as solid Championship midfielder with a bit of experience under his belt and some caps at international level. Wouldn’t have thought he’s on a great deal of money a week. Probably gives us more of a reason to part ways with Wilshere and would fit into the midfield as Noble’s replacement alongside Soucek and Rice. I hope he can take the opportunity. 

**Diangana** Another one who isn’t a signing but he returns from a successful loan spell. Looked great so far in pre-season. He’s a big addition to the squad in my opinion and I think he’ll push for a first team place. Not on a lot of money and I also think he gives us an option of letting go a winger or two, who are on more but probably won’t play. 

I think we’re still in need of a **first choice right back**, **first choice centre back**, **first choice left back** and some **depth in central midfield & a backup striker**. I’m not sure what the priority order is for that. We could still part ways with a number of players to help make these happen. 

**Masuaku** He needs to leave if we want to upgrade on Cresswell at left back. If he doesn’t he has the opportunity to take his place. He’s still a decent age. It’s not over for him. 

**Balbuena** I get the impression we’d be happy to let him go and buy a better backup defender. If not and he can rediscover his debut season form, he’s a solid backup if he does that. With Reid returning in January that gives us some more depth when the window reopens and he can be registered. Ideally we’d want a first choice defender but I don’t think he’d recover that much money to make it happen. Same as Reid.

**Wilshere** Looks like we’re ready to let him go to anyone willing to take on part of his wages. Considering how little he played he won’t be missed and would give us financial relief. 

**Anderson** I think we’d jump at the chance to cash in £30m and use it on a player or two. It doesn’t look like anyone wants him. I wouldn’t be too upset if he doesn’t leave. Probably lost his place to Fornals on the left and with Diangana’s return, it really will fire him up to rediscover his form and get back into the Brazil team. He’s an outstanding technical player who doesn’t want to influence game but if he snaps out of it, he could be a huge player for us next season.

**Lanzini** See Anderson. Although with our recent changes to our midfield shape, I think it’s going to be very difficult to play his way into the team and change the formation back. I wouldn’t be too upset if he left, or too upset if he stays. I think he might have to push for a place out wide like when he first joined the club. He played right wing at Anfield. Left wing a lot of the time after that. He’s versatile.

**Yarmalenko** Given his wages I think we would be happy to sell him but like a lot of other, that will be difficult. Bowen took the right wing role but he showed he’s got a bit in his locker to step on the pitch and do the business as a backup. 

**Snodgrass** I can’t see him pushing for a first team spot on his favoured right wing. The number 10 role he filled in for has gone from the line up. The left wing role has more than enough depth. I don’t rate him as a central midfielder to step in neither. Really he should be on the list of players we’re looking to sell. 

So I know we haven’t made big changes with who’s coming in but it’s vital we change who’s going our first. I think we’re on the right track.

But he's not a great one either. He's certainly not worth £60m, or £200k a week.

&#x200B;

Lo Celso is also not an amazing player. But he's also no where near as bad as this sub makes out. If you only looked at this sub, you would assume tanguy is legitimately one of the best midfielders in the world whilst Lo Celso was a championship level player.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the stats, whilst obscuring which player is which. One player will have the stat on the left whilst one will have the stat in the middle. For comparison, Hojberg's stats will be on the right.

Tackles per game: 1.7 - 1.4 - 2.2

Interceptions per game: 0.6 - 0.6 - 1.4

Fouls committed per game: 0.6 - 0.9 - 1.6

Key passes per game: 1.1 - 0.4 - 0.4

Times dispossessed per game: 0.8 - 1 - 0.4

Bad controls per game: 1.3 - 1.7 - 0.8

Goals per game: 0.22 - 0.18

&#x200B;

What player would you assume is which?

Of course, the one on the left is Lo Celso and the one in the middle is tanguy.

&#x200B;

Yes, these stats are cherry picked I admit, but they are rather telling. Lo Celso, despite being a CAM, matches or beats Tanguy in nearly every defensive stat. Tanguy then fails to really make up for this offensively: he does indeed have marginally more assists per game (0.07 for Lo Celso vs 0.11 for Ndombele), but not enough to make him this world beater many think he is.

&#x200B;

So why is one so hated and one so loved? Two reasons:

&#x200B;

Firstly, Tanguy is extremely flashy. People see clips of him doing some crazy skill and assume he is a God. This is all very superficial: the skills mean nothing if he then loses possession with a shit pass, which he so often does.

Secondly, Lo Celso was bought instead of Fernandes, meaning he is constantly compared to him. Why not compare the player who was bought for £55 million and is on £200k a weak wages instead of the one bought for £27 million?

&#x200B;

The truth is neither player is up to scratch at the moment. But unless you have a good argument, stop pretending like Ndombele was worth the £55 million.",0.49,0,0,0

So with the same goal difference West Ham are out-performing us with a less-talented squad because they have a system that works and a manager in Moyes who doesn't destroy his players. He creates a cohesive outfit that works for each other.

We can't let his talent and character go to waste.,False,65,140,2021-07-20 02:07:18,"(all stats from FBref)

1. He's a leader, good character in the dressing room - ([called a team meeting for West Brom by himself](https://tribuna.com/en/news/arsenal-2021-05-11-never-say-die-how-maitlandniles-inspired-west-brom-to-beat-chelsea/)), speaks very well. 


2. He has the technical ability to play as a 10, 8, either wing. He is very press resistant, with a bit of coaching it can be  fantastic. He is also ambipedal. He is 82% right foot, 18% left foot usage. For comparison, Heung Min Son is 84% right & 16% left. 


3. His one on one defending is amazing, he's shown he can lock down anyone in the league. In his performances, he has had 85+%iles in tackles, tackles won, % of dribblers tackled, blocks, tackles + interceptions. And his pressure statistics are very good also. Considering most defenders don't really unlock the part of the brain that allows them to be a great defender position wise until past 25 (frontal cortex keeps developing until you're 30), he can learn positioning. 


4. He has pace to burn. Having a player that can bomb down the wings to put a bit of urgency and pressure into the opponents will help to unlock our other attackers (if he plays LB/RB). 


5. Cool, composed character. We've [seen from his penalties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qrqa9T_eMU&t=46s&ab_channel=LIFESTYLE). How valuable is having a player like this? We've seen from the Euros how big this can be. Also to be noted: AMN makes way less mistakes than the average PL player. 



6. Local Hale End lad. We need some London representation in this team. Ainsley's been through the academy, he knows what it means to be an Arsenal player. He won't let the fans down. 


7. Driven mentality. You might think oh well he wanted to leave last year because he wasn't getting playing time. Or he didn't want to play RB. What I see in those comments is a player with self-belief. A player who thinks, I'm good enough to make it elsewhere. I care about my career progression. I'm not just a sit on the bench and get my wages paid (*cough*). 


8. He can develop into a jack of all trades, Milner type for us. I honestly see so so many comparisons between the two players. James is a personal favourite of mine, because even though he wasn't exactly the most talented (he defo doesn't have the physical gifts of AMN) he grafted on the pitch. He takes care of himself, he went to Liverpool at age 29 when everyone said he was a finished bench player. He was the most bantered signing that window. Then he went and gave admirable performances season, after season and wrote himself into the annals of football history by having the most assists of any player in CL history.


9. Following on from that, future is bright for Ainsley. He's an English international already. Even if he doesn't do well, he will retain his value. Imagine if we went to buy him now from a Brighton or West Ham off the back of a good season. How much would he cost then? £40, 45m? 

We HAVE to give him a solid chance because he still has developing to go, and he can easily develop into a long term piece for us if we want to go back to challenging for the title after 4-5 years.",0.57,65,0,0

This isn’t even a biased opinion. What I genuinely believe from watching a lot of football. We have got the most promising youngsters in the world and this time next year we will be back in the champions league and top of the premier league. 

With players like Tierney, Laca and Auba to compliment them we will now show the real Arsenal. We are better than Spurs. Better than Liverpool. Better than City. Next time we play them we will to smash them. 

Liverpool fans crowing now but for the last 30 years we have been better than them for the majority and will take our place ahead of them again soon. We are a bigger club than them. Full stop. Better stadium, better fans, classier club. Auba better than any player they’ve had probably. Plus London is the biggest and best city in the UK and in the future once we get ourselves sorted we are a much more attractive proposition to top players than the North West. I honestly see Chelsea as our biggest rivals going forward but come on they have no class compared to us. 

TLDL - Arsenal are the biggest and best team in UK and potentially the world. We have amazing youngsters and will soon be winning everything going.

"" No-one, not even Dean Smith at his most bullish, could have foreseen this, but Villa can already look back on a successful 2020/21 season after just four matches. Why? Well, no team in English top-flight history has ever been relegated after starting a season with four wins. So, Aston Villa will be a Premier League club in 2021/22, that much we know.

A top-half finish seems likely too, with only Charlton in 2005/06 and Watford in 2018/19 finishing below halfway after taking 12 points from their first four games. In fact, the lowest a team has finished after beginning with four wins is 15th, which has been done three times, including by Aston Villa themselves in 1900/01.

For me it's never ever a penalty. Llorente has pulled out of the challenge and the Soton player kicked his leg out and made contact.

Now, I'm really really glad the pen wasn't given as for me its never a foul, infact, I would say its a freekick to Leeds.

But, this is a Villa sub, so what has this got to do with Villa I hear you ask?

Well, in my opinion this is something Jack does a lot. He ghosts past someone and kicks his leg out and creates contact. Often I think there are genuine fouls but maybe half the time its Jack 'creating' contact.

I think its brilliant that the correct decision has come from VAR but it will be interesting to see what happens if this is a new precedent being set.

I have been posting on Twitter under the club's posts about how the ownership is killing this team, and was wondering if anyone shared the same views as me.

We are aiming for what is our third relegation in 6 years, meaning a consistent promotion > relegation pattern, Tony is our DOF yet isn't even *in* the country to you know, make DOF moves, like signing players?  Instead he's too busy getting excited over AEW viewership figures in the US rather than tweeting about the football club he runs.

The 'striker' argument has been going on all month and considering half the usual suspects (Tim Ream, Michael Hector) are League One-tier players, we could do with a bit of strength in the back 4 as well.

There is tons of blame going towards Scott which I understand and sympathise with but you can't polish a turd. Getting rid of him now would make no sense and inevitably send us down.

Also Anguissa took TWO YEARS to develop since we signed him back in 2018.

Ultimately, I'm just typing a wall of text here but it's basically gonna take a double relegation and huge losses for someone else to buy this team and bring it back to its former glory. Sad what's going on.

PS4 FIFA 21 Tournament

(posted with permission from the mod team)

Hey guys. Me and a couple of guys just starting a little PS4 FIFA 21 community. Based in Europe, Northern Africa & Turkey.

Our idea is to organise tournaments. Over the next 2 weeks, we're doing our first tournement.

We're starting small. The idea was to have an 8 player tournament. 2 groups of 4 teams, but at the least moment we had a drop-out.

So we're looking for at least one replacement who's willing to play 3 to 5 matches.

Rules are simple. Like the World Cup, but with Club teams and only 8. With a max rating of 4 stars.

If you're interested. DM me Or join up at [https://discord.gg/zkS8uWeGNn](https://discord.gg/zkS8uWeGNn)",0.61,3,0,0

Two are suggesting that you (SHU) would have more points compared to last year because of your vivacious support. On the other hand, I think you are missing O’Connell badly, and teams don’t respect the system you play compared to last year. I’d like to get the opinions of actual SHU fans who watch each game week in week out.",0.6,2,0,0
