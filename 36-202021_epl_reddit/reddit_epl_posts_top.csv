The specific comment is around the 32 minute mark on the podcast. Today I decided to do a deep dive and see if this was true.  

First, I looked up every FA Cup game that the team he was on played in while he was on said team. There are essentially no match reports for any games in the FA Cup qualification rounds. However, I managed to find quite a bit of evidence that I would consider proof that he has indeed played (almost) every round of the FA Cup. In the [History of the FA Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_FA_Cup) wiki, no other player is mentioned to have achieved this. Some players are said to have played every round, however this is only counting the Competition Proper rounds, not qualification.  

I'll list out every game he *could* have played in at the bottom of the post. That way, if anyone else wants to look into the games and add some proof, you know what to look for. I really only looked for evidence of each round and stopped when I found something for each round.  

I mainly tried to find the *earliest* instance of his participation in a particular round. I'll list those out here. For more recent games, I'm not going to bother linking anything because they're pretty easy to find.    

I'm sure there are other references that are out there, maybe in person for those of you in the UK. However, much of what I found were obscure videos and blogs. I'm sure some of you out there have some more knowledge I cannot find.  

**Extra-Preliminary Round**  
Vardy has never been on a team when they played in this round. This is the only round he has never played in.  

**Preliminary Round**  
1 September 2007  
Stocksbridge Park Steels 3-2 Curzon Ashton  
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDTisvI_2wg) was posted the day after the match. The YouTuber has a couple other videos from this match. You can't see anything but you can hear someone say, ""Vardy's got some speed on him.""  

**First Round Qualifying**  
11 September 2010  
FC Halifax Town 2-0 Whitby Town  
This one is by far the most obscure and hardest to prove. [This video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kaRhFwfi6dg) from the stands is hard to make much out. From the Third Round Qualifying video, we can see he's got the #7 shirt. In this video, you can make out someone that looks and moves like Vardy. Around the 1:10 mark, the guy hovering around the top of the box seems to be him. Of all the players at that time whose numbers you can see, none are a 7. Leads me to think the #7 is the one at the top of the box whose number we can't see. Also looks like his shirt is tucked like it is in the other video. I had to look at a lot of videos of Halifax Town from this season to convince myself it's him. Hopefully someone has more information and can show definitively that he's played in this round at some point.    

**Second Round Qualifying**  
27 September 2008  
Stocksbridge Park Steels 1-2 Curzon Ashton  
This one got a bit eccentric. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jcb0jMgAwA) of some of Vardy's goals for SPS shows he wore the #11. I came across [this blog post](http://facupgroundhopper.blogspot.com/2008/09/stocksbridge-park-steels-1-curzon.html) by someone who went to non-league matches. Happened to be at this match and you can pretty clearly see Vardy's #11 shirt in the photos. Looks like him as well.  

**Third Round Qualifying**  
9 October 2010  
FC Halifax Town 4-0 Harrogate Town  
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ICT1sVu45Ns) pretty clearly shows Vardy wearing the #7. It also kind of helps figure some things out in the First Round Qualifying video. He even scores in this game at the 9:45 mark.  

**Fourth Round Qualifying**  
23 October 2010  
FC Halifax Town 0-1 Mansfield Town  
Pretty straightforward. Managed to find a [match report](https://gh.soccerway.com/matches/2010/10/23/england/fa-cup/fc-halifax-town/mansfield-town-fc/1043078/?ICID=PL_MS_10) for this one.  

**First Round Proper**  
12 November 2011  
Fleetwood Town 2-0 Wycombe Wanderers  
According to the results in the wiki for the [2011-12 FA Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_FA_Cup), Vardy was a goalscorer in each of the first three rounds. I'll just link the wiki here and you can go through the Fleetwood matches and see.  

**Second Round Proper**  
2 December/13 December 2011   
Fleetwood Town 2-2 Yeovil Town  
Yeovil Town 0-2 Fleetwood Town    

**Third Round Proper**  
7 January 2012  
Fleetwood Town 1-5 Blackpool  

**Fourth Round Proper**  
26 January/12 February 2013  
Huddersfield Town 1-1 Leicester City  
Leicester City 1-2 Huddersfield Town  
I'm sure there's a match report somewhere but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=jgb0iaeepDU) shows Vardy at 13 seconds during the pre-match handshakes.  

**Fifth Round Proper**  
18 February 2017  
Milwall 1-0 Leicester City  
Vardy was a sub in this one.  

**Quarterfinals**  
18 March 2018  
Leicester City 1-2 Chelsea  
Vardy scored in this one.  

**Semifinals**  
18 April 2021  
Leicester City 1-0 Southampton  
Vardy made the pass in that Seniorman Kelechi scored from.  

**Final**  
15 May 2015  
If Vardy plays in this match, he'll have played every round of the FA Cup from the preliminary round in the qualification stages to the final.  



Here is every match that Vardy *could* have participated in by club and year.
