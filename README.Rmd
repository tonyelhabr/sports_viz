# Future Ideas

-   Stability of goal-scoring rate and/or xG over-performance

-   Madden rating EDA with UMAP + kmeans clustering (for optimal \# of UMAP groups).

-   In which sport is the leading team most likely to further their lead near the end of the game due to an opposition error, overly-aggressive tactics by the opposition, etc.? (End of game depends on the sport. Ideally, we could use a win probability model to help idenitfy end-of-game context, although it would still need some adjustment.) Extension: In which sport are gamblers most likely to lose/win due to a back-door cover?

-   Decision tree to filter down players in a sport to just one player who has achieved a very specific set of career totals/averages (i.e. <https://twitter.com/JacobEGoldstein/status/1296570734047686658>)

## Future data sets

-   "Standardized" soccer shot data locations: <https://kloppy.pysport.org/changelog/#110-2020-08-07>
