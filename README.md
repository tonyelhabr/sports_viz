# Future Ideas

-   In which sport is the leading team most likely to further their lead
    near the end of the game due to an opposition error,
    overly-aggressive tactics by the opposition, etc.? (End of game
    depends on the sport. Ideally, we could use a win probability model
    to help identify end-of-game context, although it would still need
    some adjustment.) Extension: In which sport are gamblers most likely
    to lose/win due to a back-door cover?

-   Decision tree to filter down players in a sport to just one player
    who has achieved a very specific set of career totals/averages
    (i.e. <https://twitter.com/JacobEGoldstein/status/1296570734047686658>)

-   Minutes played by new players
    ([inspiration](https://twitter.com/reinhurdler/status/1438172361790996490?s=20)

-   Which positions is it ok to have a weak spot at?
    ([inspiration](https://theathletic.com/2832130/2021/09/19/in-which-positions-can-a-team-have-a-glaring-weakness-but-still-win-the-premier-league-title/))

-   Do coaches sub-off players with yellow cards at a higher rate than
    they would otherwise?

-   watke vs. lasso impact on USMNT fandom
