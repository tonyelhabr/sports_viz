-   `shotmap.R` uses a more traditional `{ggplot2}` paradigm to make the shotmap. In particular, it leverages `facet_wrap()`. "Polishing" is needed to add logos to strip texts and to make the hex bin fills relative to each subplot instead of across all subplots.
-   `shotmap-subplots.R` leverages an approach more akin to sonofacorner's, where individual subplots are made. This eliminates the need to do as much "polishing". It leverages some `{magick}` functions to add the team logos to the plot area directly (instead of in the strip text). In the end, the logos are nicer and the hexbin fill is implemented directly with `scale_fill_gradient()`. However, this approach suffers a bit from interpolation done with convering `magick` objects back to `ggplot`s.
